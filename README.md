country-neighbours
==================
A very simple and unsophisticated script to retrieve all of the neighbors for all the countries in the world.

##Usage
Just use the neighbors.json file.

If an update needs to be done, or if you need to have the same data in some other way, use the index.html

**NB!**
Remember to replace the `username` with your geoname.org username, if you use the `index.html` file
